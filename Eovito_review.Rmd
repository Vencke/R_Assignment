## R Markdown

I was able to successfully run your code. The data inspection portion of the assignment was done well and easy to follow. 
I could see exactly what your inspecting and what you learned from this. 
The data processing was also done well and I was able to follow easily. 
However, I think it would be beneficial to annotate your lines of code in more detail so it is easier for someone with little to no background in R syntax to understand what you are doing.
I think the graph that you made to show the SNP's per chromosomes was done well and very visually appealing. 
The only thing I would change is to just annotate the data processing portion in a bit more detail, but other than that it was done very well!
