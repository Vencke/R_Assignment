# Readme file for EEOB546 R Assignemnt
## by Vencke

##### I did the homework first in R and structured my folders like this: 

#### 00_Data
* Files from Unix Assignment 

#### 01_Script

* Rmd file with the code called "AssignmentEEOB546.Rmd"
* Readme file called "README.Rmd" :D 

#### 02_Output

* Folders for the maize and teosinte files
* maize_files and teosinte_files 
* Output html file called "AssignmentEEOB546.html"

##### But it didn't work in the R Markdown file so I restructured it creates the maize_files and teosinte-files in the script folder. I tried to provide the file path to 02_Output instead of the dot ("./maize_files") but it didnt work. I am going to try to fix it for the final assignment but I am happy for any suggestions.  

### Now all the files mentioned above can be found in 01_Script.
